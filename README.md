# WhatToEat2

This app is just a proof of concept 

- Manage restaurant that users frequent
- Categorize restaurant into "GROUPS"
- Provides the ability to randomly pick a restaurnt for you  if you ever run into the infamous first world problem of not knowing what to eat!

Currently working on - proximity search using Google places api + Volley

TODO:
- Language support
- Need to refactor the cracp of the code
- Need to add backend so users and share and review restaurants -> this itself should be another project 
- add google map and phone number
- improve user interface 
- add the ability to make reservation (How?)
